Both these programs should work on any flavour of UNIX which has 'lex'.

fin:
will turn English into bad English, such as one sees written by certain
finnish persons.

biffa:
will turn English into Geordie, such as one hears spoken by Tynesiders.
NB It contains rather a lot of bad language, for realism's sake.

To create them in the current directory, type 

make all

Use
cat [file_of_text] | biffa | more
and
cat [file_of_text] | fin | more
for endless hours of fun.
